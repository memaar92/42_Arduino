# 42_Arduino
The 42 Arduino bootcamp includes a series of four team-based challenges:
- The first challenge introduced essential concepts of Arduino and basic electronics, such as LEDs, resistors, and on/off switches. 
- The second challenge added complexity by incorporating components like LCD displays and potentiometers, requiring students to display potentiometer values on the screen or control them via the terminal.
- The third challenge emphasised creativity, tasking students with designing an object that followed a moving light source using servo motors and light sensors. This project allowed students to utilise technologies like laser cutting and 3D printing for their solutions.
- In the fourth and final challenge, the Arduino microcontroller was replaced with an ESP8266. Students created a web server to control LEDs on a matrix in real-time, integrating a sound sensor to alter LED patterns or colours based on sound input.

For showcasing the third project, we 3D-printed a small satellite model:
